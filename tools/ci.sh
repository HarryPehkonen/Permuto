# Local CI — every gate this repo has, in one script, with no service anywhere.
#
# from AI-DEV-STARTER (plunk-in kit) — if you edit this file, say why in INCIDENTS.md.
#
# No GitHub, no network, no framework: this is what the git hooks in .githooks/ run,
# and you can run it by hand at any time (it is non-destructive — nothing is committed,
# staged, reverted or reformatted for you).
#
#   tools/ci.sh                      # all default stages, in order
#   tools/ci.sh build tests          # just these stages, in the order given
#   tools/ci.sh --list               # what the stages are
#   tools/ci.sh --help
#
#   git config core.hooksPath .githooks     # one-time, per clone, enables the hooks
#
# Two tiers, because a C++ full run is minutes and a commit cannot afford minutes:
#
#   fast  (pre-commit)  build tests
#   full  (pre-push)    build tests version asan tsan pristine   (what this repo can do)
#
# PERMUTO ADAPTATIONS (every deviation from the kit is listed here, with the reason):
#   * build dirs are build-ci/ + build-ci-asan/ + build-ci-tsan/, NOT build/. This repo
#     has the OLD build/ tree COMMITTED (130 of its 163 tracked files are build
#     artifacts), so a gate that builds in build/ rewrites tracked files and turns a
#     clean tree dirty on every run. build-ci* is ignored instead.
#   * no `tree` stage in the tiers: tree fails at HEAD because of that committed build/
#     (either "build/ is not ignored", or — once it IS ignored — "tracked files matched
#     by .gitignore"). Unfixable without untracking those 130 files, which is Harri's
#     call, not the gate's. The stage is still implemented and still reports the truth:
#     run `tools/ci.sh tree` to see it.
#   * no `format` stage in the tiers: the repo has no .clang-format (CODING_STANDARDS.md
#     refers to one that does not exist), and under the closest matching configuration
#     all 23 of its sources drift — cli/main.cpp alone would need 83 of its 157 lines
#     rewritten. Format-on-touch on a repo in that state is a one-time whole-tree format
#     commit first; that decision is Harri's. `tools/ci.sh format` still works.
#   * no `tidy` stage in the tiers: there is no .clang-tidy, and this repo's
#     CODING_STANDARDS.md scopes tidy to repos where it is configured ("no NEW findings
#     vs baseline (where tidy is configured)").
#   * pristine builds in ci-build/ inside the temp checkout (CI_PRISTINE_BUILD_DIR),
#     because the committed build/CMakeCache.txt makes CMake refuse a different source
#     directory on the same path.
#   * no fuzz stage: the repo has no fuzz target yet.
#
# Configuration lives in .ci.env (gitignored, optional); every knob has a default here,
# so the repo works with no config at all. See .ci.env.example.
#
# Exit status: 0 only if every stage that ran passed.
#
# One deliberate reading of "report every failure": a failing stage prints EVERYTHING
# that failed inside it (every unformatted file, every failing test, every finding) and
# then STOPS the run, because these stages are a chain — once the build fails, the
# tests, sanitizers and pristine stages would only repeat the same compiler error with
# more noise. Stages that do not depend on each other (tree, format, version) are
# cheap and run first for that reason. Where a run stops, the summary says so.

Stages:

              fails on uncommitted changes to tracked files
  format      clang-format drift — dry run against the repo .clang-format
  build       cmake configure + build, zero warnings (the stage counts them even where
              -Werror is not wired onto a target)
  tests       the test suite (ctest by default), every failure reported
  version     one version number: project(VERSION) in CMakeLists.txt == the header the
              build generates/uses, and the number every binary prints for --version
  asan        separate build dir, ASan+UBSan, same suite
  tsan        separate build dir, ThreadSanitizer, same suite
  tidy        clang-tidy, only NEW findings vs CI_TIDY_BASELINE (a baseline file is
              optional; with none, tidy must be clean)
  pristine    git archive HEAD -> temp dir -> configure, build, test: proves the
              COMMITTED tree is complete (catches files that are uncommitted or ignored)

Options:
  --require-clean     make the tree stage fail when tracked files have uncommitted edits
  --allow-untracked   do not fail when untracked, unignored files exist (deliberate escape)
  --strict-tools      a missing tool (clang-format/clang-tidy) fails instead of skipping
